## How to start using this tool

Copy desired Terraform state file(s) (`.tfstate`) to `src` folder and launch the application.
The resulting `.tf` files will be created in `bin\Debug\netcoreapp3.1\output` folder.

Use the [import](https://www.terraform.io/docs/import/usage.html) command to create the state file for specific resource.
